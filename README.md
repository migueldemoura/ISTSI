# ISTSI

ISTSI is the website and submission platform for the [IST Summer Internships].

It was built to ease the work of those behind the program and to allow the candidates to have a simple, consistent and comprehensive experience.

### Installation and Deployment

This project includes config files to create an environment with Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, among others.

* Install [Docker] and [Docker Compose]
* Go to `app/src/`, rename `settings.php.dist` to `settings.php` and fill all options.
* Go to `deployment/`, rename `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill all fields.
The available settings for the ENV variable are `dev`, `staging` and `prod`.
* Go to `deployment/nginx/shared/tls`, replace all files with your own and strip the `.dist` from the filenames.

* Start environment:

    ```sh
    $ bin/console up -d
    ```

When first starting the environment you will need to run `$ bin/console migrate` to update the database schema.
This process isn't done automatically since renamed columns are deleted upon migration (potential loss of data).

To access the dev webpage go to [istsi.localhost](http://istsi.localhost).

* Stop environment:

    ```sh
    $ bin/console down
    ```
